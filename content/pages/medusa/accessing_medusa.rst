Accessing Medusa
################
:order: 508

Command Line
************
The easiest and most reliable way of connecting to Medusa is via ``ssh``.

**Linux and macOS**
  Connecting is as simple as running the following in your terminal

  .. code::

    ssh username@medusa.ovgu.de

  To run graphical programs over SSH and have them display locally, you can
  use the ``-X`` option. However, remote X is very sensitive to latency, so it
  is only practical while on OvGU's campus.

  .. code::

    ssh -X username@medusa.ovgu.de

  macOS users need `XQuartz`_ [#XquartzVersion]_ installed in order to use the ``-X`` option.

  To skip entering your password every time you want to connect to medusa,
  you can also set up a ssh-key. If you do not have a ssh-key yet, follow the
  instructions over at `Github`_ on how set up your ssh key and how to add it
  to the ssh-agent (so that you won't have to re-enter your passphrase every
  time, or, alternatively, leave the passphrase empty). Once you have your
  ssh-key locally, you can copy it to medusa:

  .. code::

    ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_rsa.pub username@medusa.ovgu.de

  where ``id_rsa.pub`` is the filename of your public key (which is created in
   ``~/.ssh`` per default).

**Windows**
  Windows lacks built-in support for SSH, so you need to download `PuTTY`_.
  Open PuTTY, enter `medusa.ovgu.de` as the host, and select 'SSH' as the
  login protocol. Click 'open' to establish a secure connection. Enter your
  username and password, and you're ready to go.

  Running graphical programs over SSH on Windows is possible (using `VcXsrv
  <http://kumo.ovgu.de/~aqw/VcXsrv-IPSY.zip>`_), but this method is deprecated
  and VNC is strongly recommended instead.

VNC (Graphical Desktop)
***********************
VNC is for users who prefer a more familiar desktop experience or need to use
graphical programs while off-campus. VNC is a multi-step process and not as easy
as straight SSH.

First, SSH into Medusa (explained above) to 1) setup your VNC password and 2)
start your VNC server.

You only need to set your password once. It's stored **unencrypted** in a text
file, so do not use a valuable password (such as for Medusa, email, etc).

.. code::

  me@medusa:~$ vncpasswd
  Password:
  Verify:

Next, start the VNC server.

.. code::

  me@medusa:~$ vncserver

  New 'medusa:9 (me)' desktop is medusa:9

  Starting applications specified in /home/me/.vnc/xstartup
  Log file is /home/me/.vnc/medusa:9.log

Note the number ``9`` in ``medusa:9``. Yours will likely be different. Take note
of your number, as it references *your* VNC session and will be used later.

The VNC server runs until it is terminated by you (or a reboot of Medusa). If
you close your client/disconnect, it will continue to run. If you "log out" in
the session, it will terminate the server.

**Linux**
  Open a terminal and run the following:

  .. code::

    vncviewer -via medusa.ovgu.de :9

  Note the ``:9``. Make sure that this is *your* number from above.
  This command will first ask that you authenticate to Medusa, and then it
  will ask for the VNC password you set before.

**macOS**
  macOS has a VNC client built-in, but it isn't SSH aware. So a SSH tunnel
  needs to be setup first.

  .. code::

    ssh -f -L 5909:127.0.0.1:5909 username@medusa.ovgu.de sleep 60

  Then you can use VNC.

  .. code::

    open vnc://127.0.0.1:5909

  Note the number "5909" in both commands. It should be 5900 + the ``number``
  noted above. Make sure that it is *your* number.

  .. class:: todo

    **TODO**: write a simple shell script that can be ``curl``-ed into the user's path.

**Windows**
  Windows lacks a built-in VNC viewer, so you will need `TightVNC Java
  Viewer`_. Be sure to download the **TightVNC Java Viewer**; it is not the
  first link on their download page. You will also need Java installed in
  order to run it.

  Launch the viewer and enter the following information:

  * Remote Host: 127.0.0.1
  * Port: 5900 + your unique session number (e.g. 5909)
  * Check "Use SSH Tunneling"
  * SSH server: medusa.ovgu.de
  * SSH port: 22
  * SSH User: <your username>

  Note the port number: "5909". It should be 5900 + the ``number`` we
  noted above. Make sure that it is *your* number.

  Upon connecting, you will first be asked to authenticate to Medusa; then it
  will ask for the VNC password you set before.

Footnotes
*********
.. [#XquartzVersion] There have been some problems with recent XQuartz releases,
   but users have reported that version 2.7.7 works best for them. It is
   recommended to use that version until 2.7.12 is released.
