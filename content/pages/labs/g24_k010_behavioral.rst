Overview
========
The lab has three open cabins, a table with a divider for head-to-head
experiments, and a desk for those overseeing experiments.

Software
========
Open Cabins
  These 3 computers all run Debian Jessie (8). All machines have Matlab (2012b),
  PsychoPy, and Psychtoolbox installed. All machines have been configured to
  match the timing/configuration requirements of both PsychoPy and Psychtoolbox.

  Because of Matlab's network licensing, each machine is connected to the
  network.

Head-to-Head
  These 2 computers run Windows 7 and have been configured so all non-essential
  services are disabled. Both machines have Presentation (multiple versions)
  installed — and also BrainVision Analyzer 2 (for instruction purposes).

  Since they are physically close to each other, both screens can easily be
  connected to the same computer for two-person experiments.

Monitors
========
Open Cabins
  Each cabin is equipped with a Samsung S24C450

Head-to-Head
  These are non-standard monitors.
